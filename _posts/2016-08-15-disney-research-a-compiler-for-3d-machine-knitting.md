  Industrial knitting machines can produce finely detailed, seamless, 3D
  surfaces quickly and without human intervention. However, the tools used to
  program them require detailed manipulation and understanding of low-level
  knitting operations. We present a compiler that can automatically turn
  assemblies of high-level shape primitives (tubes, sheets) into low-level
  machine instructions.
