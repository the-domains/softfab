    description: "People have been designing and producing 3D printable furniture for years now, to varying degrees of success. As you would expect, 3D printing with plastic isn't always the best option for home furnishings. While there are large-scale 3D printers capable of producing full size pieces, they are not cheap and there is still the fragility of most 3D printing materials to consider."

    description: "\"Did you know,\" Platt Boyd asks me, \"that the way we construct buildings hasn't really changed for 10,000 years?

    description: "Whichever bright spark first uttered the phrase 'print is dead' (often attributed to a sexed-up misquote of media philosopher Marshall McLuhan and even a line Egon delivers in Ghostbusters) they might want to eat their words. For although the media landscape has changed dramatically since Tim Berners-Lee's little invention called the internet took hold, the physicality of print is as sought-after as ever before."
